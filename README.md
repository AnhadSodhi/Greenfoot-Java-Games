# Greenfoot-Java-Games
Assorted games in Java (Display coded with Greenfoot)

## Purpose
Some of my first Java projects, to learn the fundamentals

Spaceship Game
* Use the arrow keys to move the spaceship, and the mouse to aim
* The spacebar + one of the arrow keys will make you dash in that direction (has a cooldown)
* Right click to change weapons
* Holding down X will deactivate "Turbo Mode" (stop the character and crosshairs from shaking)

The Picnic
* Created an algorithm to control an Ant based on various criteria (closest food source, value of food sources, closest nest, etc.)
* The Ant moves entirely autonomously

## Usage instructions
* You must download and install Greenfoot to run any of the projects, since they display the game through Greenfoot.
